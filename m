Hmmm... this code does:

int __sys_setsockopt(int fd, int level, int optname, char __user *user_optv=
al,
		int optlen)
{
	sockptr_t optval;
	char *kernel_optval =3D NULL;
	int err, fput_needed;
	struct socket *sock;

	if (optlen < 0)
		return -EINVAL;

	err =3D init_user_sockptr(&optval, user_optval);
	if (err)
		return err;

And the called code does:
	if (copy_from_sockptr(&opt, optbuf, sizeof(opt)))
		return -EFAULT;


Which means that only the base of the user's buffer is checked
for being in userspace.

I'm sure there is code that processes options in chunks.
This probably means it is possible to put a chunk boundary
at the end of userspace and continue processing the very start
of kernel memory.

At best this faults on the kernel copy code and crashes the system.

Maybe there wasn't any code that actually incremented the user address.
But it is hardly robust.
