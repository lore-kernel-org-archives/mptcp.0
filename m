"Features" are not usually limited to specific kernel versions (think
about the mess that "enterprise" kernels create by backports).  And if
they are, running a userspace test should be able to detect if the
feature is present or not by the error returned to it, right?  If not,
then the feature is mis-designed.

Yes, please "skip" tests for features that are just not present, do not
fail them.

Yes.
