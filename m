Is this a different bit of bpf that that which used to directly
intercept setsockopt() requests and pass them down from a kernel buffer?

I can't held feeling that bpf is getting 'too big for its boots' and
will have a local-user privilege escalation hiding in it somewhere.

I've had to fix my 'out of tree' driver to remove the [sg]etsockopt()
calls. Some of the replacements will go badly wrong if I've accidentally
lost track of the socket type.
I do have a daemon process sleeping in the driver - so I can wake it up
and make the requests from it with a user buffer.
I may have to implement that to get the negotiated number of 'ostreams'
to an SCTP connection.
