Thank you for the explanation. (I didn't know these tests had to support "e=
nterprise" kernels.)

For features where the userspace explicitly asks to use them, that's easy. =
For events that are only created from a specific kernel version, that will =
be harder but it is maybe a sign that something else is missing on our side=
 :)

It might take a bit of time but we will look at that. I think we don't even=
 check MPTCP is available before starting the first test, we just assume it=
 is there if someone explicitly starts these tests :-)

Thank you, I didn't know (and I don't know if it is well known by kernel de=
vs and maintainers).

Cheers,
